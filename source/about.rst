Themis is a statistical mechanics software designed to obtain the association thermodynamics
of two structures (ions, molecules, crystals, nanoparticles, etc). It generates a configurational partion function by systematically sampling the phase space discrete grids to perform 
translations and rotationd of one structure around another. Interaction energy for each 
microstate can be obtained by one of the potentials implemented or by using external softwares.

Themis is a free software written in Fortran 2003 language, being available at 
https://github.com/colombari/themis under in the GPLv3+ License. It runs under Linux
environment with gfortran/gcc 5.4+ compilers. Since it was written in modules, new
potential functions and analysis routines can be implemented.

Detailed information about the methodology and some applications of current implementation is on ChemRxiv:
