``energy.bin`` **file**

Binary file containig interaction energy values for all microstates. Since all entries are written
in the right loop sequence, they can be read using the ``rerun`` feature to calculate thermodynamic
properties in a different temperature, or to write a different number of lowest-energy structures.
